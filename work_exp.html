        <p>I worked on two projects during my time at Bloomberg. Throughout my senior experience at BCA, I created a Python and Java program that converted Ruby architecture to JSON and text. I went in every Wednesday in my senior year to work on this project. It took a bit of time to get acclimated, but I was able to complete my project. The way this project works is by first making a call to GitHub to get the architecture in Python. Then, I used a connector to execute my Java code, converting the architecture to JSON.</p>
        <p>My second project was part of my summer internship, where I created a data migration project for asset management within the Bloomberg Terminal. I used Java for this project, and I came in 5 times a week during the summer as opposed to the school year. For a bit more detail, I imported the old settings and asset ids from the old service, then converted them using Java to match the new asset management terminal.</p>
