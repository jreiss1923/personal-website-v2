            <p class="para">I'm a third year at Northeastern Univeristy studying Computer Science and Political Science. I prefer back-end development over front-end, and my favorite things to create all involve automation in some way. Python is my favorite language, after all! I love making useful and creative solutions to the mundane problems that affect my life, always making what I do a bit easier every day.</p>
            <p class="para">Outside of coding, I enjoy baking, exercising and practicing basketball, and a massive assortment of books and games. My favorite book is Fahrenheit 451, and my favorite game is a hotly contested race between Magic: The Gathering and Smash Ultimate. I believe the best way to solve problems is straightforward and elegant, hence my choices of Infect as my Magic deck of choice (I get to kill people at 10 life points), and King K. Rool as my main in Smash Ultimate.</p>
            <p class="para">Most of all, I love conquering the problems in front of me. Every puzzle is a challenge to defeat, and the satisfaction of a job well done is all the reward I need.</p>
